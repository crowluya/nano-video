        "question": "Nano Banana vs Sora vs Veo 3 - which is better?",
        "answer": "Each model has its strengths: Sora 2 excels at realistic motion and high-quality output, perfect for cinematic videos. Veo 3.1 Fast is the fastest option with multiple generation modes, ideal for quick turnaround. Nano Banana Edit is great for image editing before video generation. We recommend trying all models with your free credits to see which fits your needs best."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use Nano Banana videos commercially?",
        "answer": "Yes! All videos generated on our platform come with commercial use rights. You can use them for UGC ads, TikTok content, YouTube videos, e-commerce stores, and any other commercial purposes without any restrictions."

      {
        "question": "How long does it take to generate a video?",
        "answer": "Video generation typically takes 3-10 minutes depending on the model and complexity. Veo 3.1 Fast is the quickest (3-5 minutes), while Sora 2 may take 5-10 minutes for higher quality results. You can track the progress in real-time with our live status updates."

      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to create an account to use it?",
        "answer": "You can try the video generation without an account, but creating a free account allows you to save your videos, track your generation history, and manage your credits more easily. Account creation is quick and only requires an email or social login."

      },
      {
        "question": "What are the best prompts for video generation?",
        "answer": "The best prompts are detailed and specific. Describe the motion you want, camera movements, lighting, and atmosphere. For example: 'Camera slowly pans across a sunset beach while waves gently crash on the shore' works better than just 'beach video'. Include details about speed (slow, fast), direction (left to right, zoom in), and mood (calm, energetic)."
